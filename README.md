# My Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository showcases my passion for data analytics, insight generation, visualizations, model building, and project planning. Each project represents a significant step in my journey into the world of data science.

## Project 1: App Rating Prediction

In this project, I developed a model to predict app ratings based on various app information. The dataset used was the Google Play Store data, which included fields such as app category, reviews, size, installs, and more. I performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and built a linear regression model to predict app ratings.

## Project 2: Comparative Study of Countries

This project focuses on comparing various parameters of countries using Tableau. I analyzed data related to income, life insurance share, market share, penetration, and more. Using interactive visualizations and dashboards, I compared the performance of different countries and identified key insights related to their characteristics.

## Project 3: Comparison of Regions based on Sales

In this project, I used Tableau to compare sales between two regions. The goal was to analyze and visualize sales data, including total sales, average sales per order, number of customers, and more. By creating interactive visualizations and utilizing filters, I provided a comprehensive comparison of sales performance between the selected regions.

## Project 4: Data Manipulation and Reporting with Power BI

Using Power BI, I worked on a project that involved manipulating and reporting on Zomato's restaurant data. The project included tasks such as data transformation, data blending, creating visualizations for restaurant comparisons, analyzing average ratings and costs, and designing a multi-page report with easy navigation.

## Project 5: Smart Weather using Jira (Agile Scrum Master Project)

In this project, I applied Agile Scrum Master concepts to analyze a hypothetical organization called GTM systems. The project focused on developing a SmartWeather system that aggregates weather data from multiple providers and provides meaningful insights for businesses. I created epics, user stories, and tasks in Jira, and followed the Scrum framework to complete a sprint.
